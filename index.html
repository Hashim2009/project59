        <p class="para">My hobby is solving rubik's cube.I got the interest from my uncle who knows how to solve a 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 last year. I only had some 3x3 and had no easier cube at home so I asked my father to buy me a 2x2 and a pyraminx for me. My father bought me the cubes I needed to start cubing.I first learned how to solve a pyraminx by chance and started solving it frequently and learned how to solve the pyraminx. Soon , I watched a tutorial on how to solve a 2x2 rubik's cube.

            It took a long time for me to solve the 3x3. I searched many tutorials but I could not learn how to do it but one day I found it and managed to solve the 3x3 rubik's cube . Soon, it was time to solve the big cubes , which were 4x4 to 7x7. First, I solve the 4x4 with another tutorial. It was hard because it had two long algorithms that i had to learn for parity but I did it. I solved the cube for about 20 times.However it broke. I felt upset but it was time to move to the next level which was the 5x5. I tried doing by myself but was unsure of one step which 4x4 was different from 5x5 and soon managed to solve it. Next was the 6x6. People say if you can solve the 6x6, you can solve any cube , it just gets more complex and needs more time. I saw the tutorial and realised I did not need that tutorial at all and managed to solve it with ease.Soon, it was 7x7. I did not care about watching a tutorial and managed to solve it. However, there is still more to cubing.

   There is also cubes that actually do not function like a usual 3x3. I needed to learn different notation to different cubes.The cubes are pyraminx, megaminx, skewb and square-1.I can solve the first three  but square-1 has a parity which is long and has a different notation so it remains the only cube in my collections which takes luck for me to solve as parity does not come all the time. It is also the only cube in my collection which also shapeshifts as well.

 Around August last year, I introduced cubing to my fiends. They were shocked that I can do it and wanted me to teach them how to do it as well. I recommended the tutorial that helped me to solve the rubik's cube . They took their own time to learn how to solve the 3x3 rubik's cube while I was finding ways to help me solve it faster. Then, my friends told it to their friends and everyone started learning how to solve the rubik's cube. We had a lot of competitions between us but I was always the best in my class. I became more popular and made new friends.My teacher noticed this wonderful hobby in me. I was also model student so my teacher awarded me an 8x8 rubik cube. I was very happy. Then, it settled back down,only to explode the next year. This time not only my class but two other classes were learning how to cube.This made me even more popular among other classes .Soon, it settled back down but the popularity remains the same. Currently, I take 15 sec for 2x2 , 50 sec for 3x3 ,3 min for 4x4 ,7 min for 5x5 ,16 min for 6x6 , 25 min for 7x7,  30 sec form pyraminx, 6 min for megaminx and 45 sec for skewb.
